Notable NOVA Eateries
=======

Replacing http://www.tinyurl.com/eatnova with more of a custom implementation.  Uses the Google Maps API, which is excellent.

This is a longer-term work in progress (both the eating and the coding).

Uploaded periodically to [http://www.novafoodmap.com](http://www.novafoodmap.com).

Works best in Webkit (Chrome/Safari).  Buggy in Firefox.  No idea how it behaves in IE.  Admittedly cross-browser compatibility just isn't a huge priority right now.
