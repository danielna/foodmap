  <name>Notable NOVA Eateries</name>
  <description><![CDATA[Applicable demographic information that will help to explain the selection of eateries on this map:

- 20-something
- Employed, full time
- Asian descent
- Will pay for quality, but rarely over $30
- Otherwise, cheap eats are preferred almost always

Color scheme:
Green: Cheap (<= $10)
Yellow: Moderate ($10 < $ <= $25)
Red: Expensive (> $25)

Intentionally omitting common food chains, which is why Red Robin is not on this list.  But I've got love for Red Robin.

Top 5 at the moment:
Some permutation of Duangrats, Tachibana, Rose Kabob, Ray's the Steaks, and A&J/Pho Sate.

If you can't see the description, use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move around the map.

There will be rolling updates to this list.]]></description>

    <name>Duangrat&#39;s Thai Restaurant</name>
    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">Thai, $15+:<br>One of my top 5 restaurants. There&#39;s been a sad commodification of Thai restaurants in suburban America (see: Tara Thai), and it&#39;s easy to forget there&#39;s more to it than Pad Thai with shrimp.  Duangrats is one of the best restaurants, at any price, in NOVA, and it&#39;s cheap.  I&#39;ve never had anything on the menu that I didn&#39;t think was stellar, and the tastes are seriously that of a restaurant 2 to 3 times as expensive.  In a very unassuming building in an unassuming area, Duangrats is a gem.  Also, the small plates/tapas menu is excellent. I generally don&#39;t believe in tapas, but Duangrats has made me a believer.  It&#39;s overwhelmingly in your interests to try something different here, like a fried fish dish, rather than something generic like &quot;drunken noodles.&quot;  But go for the small plates menu.  Get the lychee stuffed with meat.  Seriously.</div>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">Sushi, $25-$30:<br>In my top 5 restaurants in NOVA.  The best sushi restaurant in the area, and owned by actual Japanese people, which I think makes a difference.  The difference in the quality of fish here is distinct compared to other sushi restaurants in the area.  If it&#39;s not a weekday, make a reservation.  I like it so much that I go here with the fam on my birthdays.</div>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">Iranian Kabobs, ~$15:<br>In my top 5 of restaurants anywhere.  I hype up this place like crazy to everyone I know and it always lives up to the hype.  While people say all the meats are good, I only ever order the Chicken platter with half rice, half salad.  If you&#39;re not super hungry, get the Chicken Kabob Junior, which is probably 80% of the non-junior portion.</div>]]></description>

The best steak I&#39;ve had anywhere, including cumberbund-mandatory places like Morton&#39;s.  Steaks come with unlimited garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach, and complimentary bread and seasoned cashews to start.  I always order the Cajun Ribeye.</div>]]></description>

    <name>A &amp; J Restaurant</name>
    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">Taiwanese, $10:<br>I really love A&amp;J, which is (so I hear) an authentic Taiwanese restaurant.  I love Taiwanese food because it&#39;s so much lighter than typical Americanized Chinese food.  The menu is almost tapas like, and it&#39;s fun because you can order a bunch of smaller $4-$5 dishes and share amongst friends.  They also have good beef noodle soup.  My favorite dishes are the soups with fried pork and the rice dish with the meat and boiled egg (sounds strange, but it&#39;s fantastic).</div>]]></description>

    <name>Pho Sate</name>
    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">Pho, $8:<br>Okay so let&#39;s stop fooling ourselves, 90% of pho joints are exactly the same.  Unless you hail from Saigon you&#39;re not really differentiating nuances in broth.  Superficially Pho Sate is like that, until they bring out the dish of Sate sauce and blow every other pho restaurant out of the water.  It&#39;s a non-spicy, smokey pepper oil that you pour into the broth that makes the world a better place.  Their other soup dishes are pretty good too; I like the seafood egg noodle bowl.  Like every other pho restaurant your food will come out in 30 seconds.  Cash only.</div>]]></description>

Seafood pancake appetizer (pajun) is good too.  But you know what's even better here?  THE CUCUMBER KIMCHI.  Seriously.  I could eat it for the rest of my life.  I think it's marinated in crack.</div>]]></description>

Large selection to choose from, including pizzas that feign authenticity by including toppings like arugula and olive oil.  Large, crispy thin crust slices.  They have pastas and gelato and whatnot here, but why bother with that stuff when you could be eating more pizza?</div>]]></description>

    <name>Bahn Mi DC Sandwich</name>
    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">Bahn Mi, $3.50:<br>Bahn Mi DC is located near the famous (and in my opinion, over-hyped) Pho 75 off of route 50 in Falls Church.  I&#39;ve only been here once, but the roast pork Bahn Mi was distinctly different (and better) than the one from Song Que.  The sandwich menu here also appears to be more extensive than the one at Song Que, so I&#39;ll venture out into trying other sandwiches in the future and update this review.  There&#39;s no seating here, as the rest of the facility is used to sell Vietnamese groceries.  As of May 1, 2011, there&#39;s a sign under the menu that says &quot;buy 5 sandwiches get 1 free.&quot;  If you don&#39;t want to die, do yourself a favor and take out the small green peppers from the sandwich before you eat it.</div>]]></description>

    <name>Song Que</name>
    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">Bahn Mi, $3.50:<br>Bahn Mi are Vietnamese sandwiches, and Song Que is the destination Anthony Bourdain visited for bahn mi during the DC episode of No Reservations.  They&#39;re sizable, especially for their price.  If you&#39;re hungry you could probably eat two in one sitting.  I typically go with chicken or pork and avoid anything with &quot;head cheese,&quot; which is a cheese-like substance made with head-meat... yeah.  The bubble tea here is also good, and very fresh.  The mango bubble tea tastes like you&#39;re literally sticking a straw into a mango, with no added sugar/ingredients.</div>]]></description>

    <name>Thanh Son Tofu / Bubble Tea</name>
    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">$3.50, Bubble Tea:<br>Thanh Son is in the parking madness but eating goodness that is Eden Center, on the far left wall of the shopping center.  It&#39;s called &quot;Thanh Son Tofu&quot; because there are lots of old Vietnamese grandmas waiting in line to buy bags of tofu, which means you know the place really knows their bean curd.  I&#39;m not much of a bean curd guy so I stick to the bubble tea.  For $3.50 you can choose a very sizable bubble tea in a variety of flavors (normal: strawberry, coffee, pineapple, taro, mango, etc... weird: durian) with quality bubbles and/or jelly.  Being lactose intolerant, I was pleased that they could accommodate my request for no milk.  The bubble &quot;tea&quot; (smoothie) here is the best I&#39;ve had in VA; better than Song Que.  They have a lot of other interesting looking offerings here than I&#39;m unfamiliar with (rice dishes paired with mushrooms and other vegetables) that I&#39;d like to try but have no idea how to order.  I often feel that way in Eden Center.</div>]]></description>

    <name>Church Street Pizza</name>
    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">Pizza by the slice, $2:<br>There&#39;s a serious lack of quality NY-style pizza by the slice joints in NOVA.  You can get a solid slice at Church Street Pizza, which is easy to miss on one of the back streets of Vienna.  It&#39;s next to a dance studio.  It&#39;s also perpetually filled with soccer moms and their children, for better or for worse.  The only pizza I like better in the area is Tony&#39;s NY Style Pizza in the Fair Lakes Shopping Center.</div>]]></description>

    <name>Santini&#39;s New York Style Deli</name>
    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">Hoagies/Pizza, $10:<br>Solid selection of different sandwiches, including but not limited to common deli meats.  You can get hot breaded chicken/steak sandwiches here also which is nice.  Sides are good, if you&#39;re in the mood for something like curly fries or onion rings.  I haven&#39;t had the pizza by the slice, but I hear it&#39;s good too.  Conveniently it&#39;s located right next to Oakmarr so you can replenish your energy after frustratingly shanking balls on the driving range (like I do).  They&#39;re hardcore Yankees fans, but I try not to judge them too much while I eat.</div>]]></description>

    <name>Sunflower Vegetarian Rstrnt</name>
    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">Vegetarian, $10:<br>I&#39;m nowhere near vegetarian, but Sunflower is solid eats.  It&#39;s essentially vegetarian Chinese food, and they even make variants of common Chinese favorites like &quot;General Tso&#39;s Surprise.&quot;  While that may sound like a train wreck, it&#39;s actually an excellent dish -- made with seitan, the soy protein, instead of chicken. Believe it or not, I might even prefer &quot;General Tso&#39;s Surprise&quot; to the real thing.  The other dishes are good too, but I can&#39;t remember any off the top of my head.</div>]]></description>

I&#39;m not sure how many eggs they use to make their omelettes here but they resemble a small yellow tire on your plate.  They offer a variety of pancakes on the menu with various embedded fruits, and you can substitute specialty pancakes into your order for a small charge.  I don&#39;t really eat out for breakfast often, but when I do OHOP doesn&#39;t disappoint.</div>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">$4-$5, Froyo: <br>So I&#39;ve been to Red Mango locations before (see: Clarendon) and they sucked.  The Vienna location, by contrast, is awesome.  As opposed to the Clarendon location the Vienna Red Mango is entirely self-serve for both the froyo flavors and toppings, so you can try all of their 8 flavors and 16-20 toppings if your heart so desires and then pay based on weight.  The Clarendon location completely screws you over on toppings by doing this &quot;I&#39;ll smash a tiny teaspoon of fruit bits into the side of your undersized yogurt cup and charge you $2 per&quot; thing while only offering 3 or so flavors.  While I&#39;ve got love for original tart flavored froyo, the consensus among all comers is that the white peach is king.  The froyo here is superior to Fruity Yogurt, but the parking situation sucks.  Don&#39;t plan on making a left out of the parking lot.</div>]]></description>

Get the tart, the honeydew, and the taro, and then get the hell out of Tysons.</div>]]></description>

Basically Spike ate at Shake Shack in NYC, asked himself &quot;Hmm, how can I copy this in almost every way but make it better?&quot; and opened Good Stuff.  The Obama burger is my favorite, but even the plain burger is really good.  For a side get the onion petals, and the chipotle/mango mayo dipping sauces are the best.  The sriracha one is okay, if you like the stuff they use in spicy tuna rolls.  The old bay mayo is disgusting.</div>]]></description>

I think it may be a hair cheaper here also.  Just like Duangrats, the food is excellent.  A great super casual spot for Thai.  If you&#39;re wearing ball shorts and a shirt with stains on it, go to Rabieng.</div>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">Burgers, $13: <br>Joe&#39;s Burgers is one of the few legitimate contenders to Ray&#39;s Hell Burger that I&#39;ve had in NOVA.  It&#39;s located in a very small, very loud, very parking unfriendly location in McLean, but the burgers and fries are seriously great. Probably the best sweet potato fries I&#39;ve ever had.  Although this is very much a palate-specific assessment, I think the specialty burgers here are more appealing than the ones at Rays with a greater variety of toppings and flavors.  At the suggestion of the waiter (who was cool) I got the chorizo burger, which according to the website contains &quot;HOUSEMADE BERKSHIRE PORK SAUSAGE WITH ROMESCO SAUCE, FRIED ORGANIC EGG, JALAPENO JACK CHEESE, SMOKED MAYONNAISE.&quot;  It. Was. Awesome.  Blue cheese loving friends say the Port Wine Blue Cheese was fantastic, and I&#39;ve also enjoyed the French Dip.  The downsides: a smidgen more expensive than Rays, smaller and lower quality burger patties than Rays (unavoidable), a wait during busy times, very loud inside and families with little kids dressed in little league apparel dominate the clientele.  But that&#39;s McLean for you.</div>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">Sushi Buffet, $12-$13:<br>Yes, that is not a typo; a legitimate high-quality sushi buffet for roughly $12.50.  Ridiculous.  A friend of mine claims that the non-buffet sushi bests the quality at Tachibana (which is hard for me to believe), but because he swears allegiance to Yuraku I&#39;m going to give it another non-buffet shot.  Yelp reviews say that the wait at this place can get long during prime times, which I believe due to both the low price and smaller size of the facility.  I went at 2:00pm on a Saturday and seating was clear, so I&#39;d recommend that for others who are willing to make the ~30min trek to Germantown, MD.  Definitely a great find.</div>]]></description>

The lunch specials/American-style Chinese food here is standard mall-style crap, but the authentic Chinese dishes are much, much better.  I haven't tried much of the menu yet but apparently the chef here moved from the highly regarded restaurant Oriental Regency that used to be down the street.  The Peking Duck here is a particularly great value at $28, especially compared to the $45 duck at Peking Gourmet Inn.  It comes with an entire crispy duck which is carved at the table, pancakes, hoisin sauce and green onions.  The markup at Peking Gourmet Inn is not worth it if you want duck alone, although the menu there is more extensive than the one here.  If you go to China Wok just remember not to get something typical like "orange chicken," because it will suck.</div>]]></description>

The owners should be billionaires; they&#39;re sitting on a winning lottery ticket but have no idea how to market their product.  Bon Chon is chicken fried multiple times and glazed with a soy-garlic sauce, resulting in a product that&#39;s strangely super crispy yet not messy to eat.  It&#39;s like the evolution of popeyes/KFC/insert other preconception of fried chicken.  And the drumsticks are the size of your head.  Notes: (1) Call ahead and place your order, because the chicken takes at least an hour to prepare; (2) Every time I&#39;ve had the &quot;spicy&quot; it&#39;s been unenjoyably spicy, so I avoid it now; (3) I always order &quot;large drumsticks only.&quot;  Also, for reasons that defy all reason and logic Bon Chon doesn&#39;t have call waiting at the Annandale location.  The Fairfax location has better decor and a more competent wait staff.</div>]]></description>

Located in Adams Morgan, it&#39;s a small, family-run, cash only operation marked by the huge line outside its building.  So the way it works is you line up before the restaurant opens and they let in the first 25 or so people, in order.  Those people place their orders, in order, and the single old male chef makes their orders, in order.  After a table clears a new set of patrons are seated.  Basically, if you&#39;re number 26 you&#39;re going to be waiting outside for over an hour, so get their early and wait.  The food is handmade and excellent.  Portions are enormous.</div>]]></description>

That&#39;s when all the NOVA azns are returning from da klubz, which is why you should avoid honey pig like the plague from 12am-4am.  Otherwise, it&#39;s a relatively cheap place to get a variety of meats cooked at your table, if you don&#39;t mind the sound of really loud and really bad Korean techno.  It tends to appeal to a younger crowd and the meat quality isn&#39;t the greatest here, but you get what you pay for.  Also you can drink to your heart&#39;s content, if you&#39;re into that type of thing.  It&#39;s probably going to cost around $25-$30 to eat enough meat to be full, but you should be seriously full.</div>]]></description>

Why George Bush's preference for eating at your restaurant is a positive endorsement is beyond me.
