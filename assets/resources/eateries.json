There's been a sad commodification of Thai restaurants in suburban America (see: Tara Thai), and it's easy to forget there's more to it than Pad Thai with shrimp.  Duangrats is one of the best restaurants, at any price, in NOVA, and it's cheap.  I've never had anything on the menu that I didn't think was stellar, and the tastes are seriously that of a restaurant 2 to 3 times as expensive.  In a very unassuming building in an unassuming area, Duangrats is a gem.  Go exclusively for the small plates/tapas menu, which I believe is 11am-3pm on Weekends and 5-630pm on weekdays. I generally don't believe in tapas, but Duangrats has made me a believer.  It's overwhelmingly in your interests to try something different here, like a fried fish dish, rather than something generic like \"drunken noodles.\"  But go for the small plates menu.  My fav small plates: pork stuffed lychee, beef crepe, deep fried cod, and grilled calamari.  But they're all good.</p>.",

It's literally within the corner of a Sunoco gas station, with no visible sign from the street indicating that there's a restaurant inside.  The ordering menus are hand-written and taped to the wall, and the maximum occupancy of the facility itself is a single table with 3 bar stools.  The food, however, is incredible.<p><p>When I got to the restaurant (if you can call it that) I told the guy behind the counter that I drove 40 minutes to get there and had no idea what to order.  He said, \"don't worry, I'll take care of you guys.\"  He proceeded to bring out a collection of tacos, huaraches, tortas, steak dishes, etc.  Everything was fantastic.  The meats were well spiced and the use of real Mexican cheese and freshly made tortillas made a huge difference. My single favorite item was the beef tongue tacos.  After a satisfying and substantial meal we were ready to foot a significant bill, but the final tally?  A little over $40 for four people.  Crazy.</p>.",

And despite the size and quality of the food it's still cheaper per roll/piece than other sushi restaurants in the area.<p><p>Of course, there's always a catch.  Yelp reviews say that the wait at this place can get long during prime times, which I believe due to both the low price and smaller size of the facility.

The parking situation here is terrible, so if you're coming during a busy time expect to park near Elevation Burger and walk down the street.  They also don't have the reputation of being the most courteous servers in the world but I don't know why people expect Ritz level service for an $8.50 meal.  A half chicken with two sides is a serious size; I like the yucca fries (potatoes on steroids) and salad.  It seems to be on the average-to-lower end of prices for similar Peruvian chicken joints in the area.</p>.",

This place is popularized by the presence of hundreds of photos of politicians and dignitaries on the walls, especially George Bush.  Why George Bush's preference for eating at your restaurant is a positive endorsement is beyond me.  Despite my inability to get over my political leanings when writing restaurant reviews, the food here is definitely good.  Going without a reservation is pointless during prime times.  The odd-hour \"lunch for x\" deals are a better bang for the buck.</p>.",
